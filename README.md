paraGraphic is a visual text analysis tool that renders a 3D model of relationships between words.  Drawing on machine learning and statistical analysis, paraGraphic determines the three ideas that make the most difference to the text, and then plots each word in relation to those ideas.  


We designed paraGraphic because we were interested in exploring machine learning in relation to language analysis.  


To analyze your own text, simply locate the input form inside the drawer, and paste your text and title and hit submit.

After a few seconds, you will see the visualization of your text as well as the 3 key ideas from your text represented as x, y, and z axes(information will be in input form).
