                            paraGraphic is a text visualization tool that lets you
                            see relationships between words
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            paraGraphic will render a 3D model of any text -- just copy & paste
                            it into the input form.  The words in the text appear as spheres in
                            a 3-dimensional graph, arranged according to their relationship to key
                            words chosen as end points (labels) for the graph's axes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            paraGraphic uses Google's word2vec, a powerful natural language processor that
                            "learns" contextual relationships between words based on their occurrence in
                            a large volume of training material.
